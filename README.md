# OSKD

An open-source e-bike display for KT controllers. Based on a custom PCB with an ESP32 and a SPI display.

## About 

This project started in 2021 when I bought my first e-bike. The bike came with a KT controller and a display that I didn't like. I wanted to have a display that would be more customizable and would have more features. I found out that there are some open-source projects that allow you to use an ESP32 as a display for KT controllers. I decided to make my own version of such a display.
